Micro Frontends
---------------

What is a micro frontend?

- Decomposing frontend monoliths into smaller, simpler chunks that can be developed, tested and deployed independently, while still appearing to customers as a single cohesive product. We call this technique micro frontends.

Benefits

Some of the key benefits that we've seen from micro frontends are:

- smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
- more scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams
- the ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion than was previously possible
